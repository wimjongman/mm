## Ramp Down

After RC1 is released, builds will be produced weekly until the 3.0
release. In the RC phase only bugs marked P2 or higher or severity major
or higher will be fixed. APIs will not change except to address critical
fixes based on integrator feedback, until RC3, at which point APIs will
be frozen. Any API changes or other changes affecting integrators will
be posted on will be posted on .

# Scope

The first goal of Mylyn is to make task and context management
seamlessly integrated with the Eclipse Platform by providing rich and
extensible frameworks for task repository connectors, structure bridges
and team support. The second goal is to provide a reference
implementation of the Task-Focused UI for the Eclipse SDK. This includes
structure bridges for the artifacts supported by the SDK which include
Java, PDE, Ant and generic files. It also includes the Bugzilla
Connector as the reference task repository implementation, and CVS
integration as the reference team support. Additional features can be
considered based on the availability community contributions and
resources.

## Priorities

In addition to using the planned themes listed below, we need to
continue prioritizing the ongoing input of our growing user community.
Committers should prioritize bugs in the following order. This order
need not be used if a bug contains a community contribution of a patch,
in which case the [quality of the
patch](http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_Contributor_Reference#Contributing_patches)
determines the priority.

1.  Frameworks & APIs: Tasks, Context, Team, Monitor, headless use
2.  UI: Tasks List, Task Editor, Task-focused UI
3.  Connectors: Bugzilla (reference implementation), Trac (committer
    supported), JIRA (community supported)

## Platforms

  - Eclipse: 3.3 and 3.4 Milestones (only latest milestone supported at
    time of release)
  - Java: JRE 5.0 or later required
  - Operating Systems: all supported by Eclipse

## Deferred Items

*June 2008 update*: As with previous releases, we received a tremendous
amount of user and integrator feedback during the Mylyn 2.x and 3.0
cycles (1997 reports filed since the Mylyn 2.0 release). Per the
priorities listed above, our primary focus has been the APIs in order to
improve the quality of the framework and support the rapidly growing
number of Mylyn extensions. While we have resolved over 1500 reports
since the 2.0 release, we have needed to defer a considerable number of
reports, especially enhancement requests and significant UI changes. We
will be prioritizing these reports, and the items marked *\[deferred\]*
below, for the Mylyn 3.1 release cycle (see ).

# API Themes

Legend: in progress, <font color=green>completed</font>,
<font color=gray>optional</font>

## Context API

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Remove need for use of internals**: make it
    possible to create bridges without relying on Context Core and UI
    internals </font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Context framework**: support extensions to
    other languages, e.g. JEE, AspectJ, DLTK</font>

## Tasks API

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Synchronization Jobs**: support
    cancellation, provide factories for creating Job objects</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Task List Data Model**: make data model
    thread-safe, specify data structure (e.g. no cycles), review type
    hierarchy</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Task Schema**: remove need to extend
    AbstractTask, change query interface to require Task Data, provide
    extended task schema with a default attribute mapping</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Task Editor**: decompose AbstractTaskEditor
    and make extensibility explicit</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Attachments**: integrate attachments as
    stream-based resources</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Authentication**: support additional
    authentication types, e.g. SSL-certificates</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Task List Import/Export**: provide a generic
    import/export API</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Common Task Schema**: we currently have a common
    Java API with attribute mappints, it could be beneficial for
    connector implementors to have access to a common XML schema.</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>'''Task List reuse: improve modularity of content
    providers, filters, interest, presentations</font>

## Team API

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Distribution**: making reuse of framework
    more generic, supporting distribution without requiring the Eclipse
    SDK</font>

# UI Themes

## Context UI

  - **\[deferred\] Improve feedback and usability of Alt+click
    navigation**: make this feature more discoverable and easier to use.


<!-- end list -->

  - **\[deferred\] Improve resource change listening**: opening projects
    currently causes them to become interesting, as does checking out of
    CVS , ,

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve fidelity of DOI model**: the model
    implementation or tuning has not changed since the 0.3 release, and
    we need to iterate on the propagation mechanism and scaling factors
    in order to increase the information density of focused
    views.</font> , ,

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve UI for interest manipulation**:
    performance and discoverability need improving, action should be
    hidden when no task context is active.</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Improve DOI model refactoring support**: some
    refactorings cause the model to lose elements , , </font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Improved editor management policy**: restore
    editors when no mementos available </font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Improve context preview facility**: performance
    need improvement, activation should not be required, can provide
    compare facilities</font>,

## Tasks UI

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve bug reporting feedback loop**. When
    an error happens we should make it easier for to report a bug to the
    relevant task repository. Ensure that bundlings can provide
    additional handling to retain the producer/consumer
    separation.</font> , , Platform:

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Streamline task creation**. Make it easier
    to create tasks, fork them, or promote local tasks to repository
    tasks. </font>, ,

## Task Editor

  - **\[deferred\] Improve information density on initial open**. For
    common cases the editor should not need to be scrolled after being
    opened.

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve representation of people**. People
    are currently treated as email addresses. They should instead be an
    object that supports flexible display and operations such as content
    assist and additional actions.)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>'''Improve performance of open. Tasks with
    very long comments or a large number of comments can be slow to open
    due to our use of multiple source viewers, and to to the wrapping
    computation of source viewers. </font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve display and navigation of attributes
    and related tasks and artifacts**. Associated tasks, such as
    dependencies, subtasks, and duplicates. Attachment display also
    needs to be improved.</font> ,

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Support saving unsubmitted tasks**: allow
    new tasks to be created while disconnected from the
    repository</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Make the save lifecycle more flexible**. Improve
    support of direct manipulation in a view (e.g. marking *Complete*
    via the *Task List*) and better handling or edits with additional
    workflow (e.g. attachments).</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Synchronize time active with repository**:
    integrate Mylyn's active time tracking with task
    repositories.</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Ease Editing**: Improve interaction with the
    editor area and support rich/html/wiki editing where appropriate
    (e.g. repositories that use markup in comments).</font>

## Task List

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve Backup and Restore**: ensure that
    users can't lose more than one hour of changes</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve Task List Rendering**: especially on
    Mac and Linux</font>  \[made progress, improvements for subtasks
    still needed\]

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve scheduling and due date
    presentation**: reduce amount of red visible in a typical Task
    List</font> , , , ,

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve Task Archive UI**: Design better
    interaction for Archive and Uncategorized categories</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Improve desktop notification mechanism**:
    make it easier to interact with and more aesthetically
    pleasing</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=darkgreen>**Customization**: support customized display
    of attributes displayed</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>'''Support search of local tasks</font>:

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Improve presentation of incoming
    changes**</font>: consider providing an incoming presentation()

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>Improve experience working with a minimized Task
    List: e.g. show active task and working set somewhere on trim when
    minimized, ensure no visual redundancy when Task List
    visible.</font>
