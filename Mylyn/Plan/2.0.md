**RC Ramp down plan for
[Europa](Europa_Simultaneous_Release "wikilink")**: after RC0 is
produced RCs will be produced weekly until the 2.0 release. In the RC
phase only bugs marked P2 or higher or severity major or higher will be
fixed. APIs will not change except to address critical fixes. Any API
additions or changes will be summarized in an email sent to mylar-dev.

# Scope

The first goal of Mylar is to make task and context management
seamlessly integrated with the Eclipse Platform by providing rich and
extensible frameworks for task repository connectors, structure bridges
and team support. The second goal is to provide a reference
implementation of the Task-Focused UI for the Eclipse SDK. This includes
structure bridges for the artifacts supported by the SDK which include
Java, PDE, Ant and generic files. It also includes the Bugzilla
Connector as the reference task repository implementation, and CVS
integration as the reference team support. Additional features can be
considered based on the availability community contributions and
resources.

# Priorities

In addition to using the planned themes listed below, we need to
continue prioritizing the ongoing input of our growing user community.
Committers should prioritize bugs in the following order. This order
need not be used if a bug contains a community contribution of a patch,
in which case the [quality of the
patch](http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_Contributor_Reference#Contributing_patches)
determines the priority.

1.  Frameworks & APIs: Tasks, Context, Team, Monitor, headless use
2.  UI: Tasks List, Task Editor, Task-focused UI
3.  Connectors: Bugzilla (reference implementation), Trac (committer
    supported), JIRA (community supported)

# Platforms

  - Eclipse 3.3: supported
  - Eclipse 3.2: supported, post 2.0 maintenance builds only
  - Java 5 or later required

# Themes

Legend: in progress, <font color=green>completed</font>,
<font color=gray>optional</font>

## Task List

  - <font color="green">**Support date view in Task List.** A common way
    of organizing tasks to work on in the current week is by day. We
    should support this by integrating the Task Activity view's date
    range container presentation with the Task List. (bug 147084)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Support integration with planning and
    calendaring tools.** Many task repositories have facilities for task
    planning in the form of milestones, due dates, and other
    organizations of tasks. The Task List and Task Editor should support
    such extensions, for example, allowing the Task List to be organized
    by milestone. (e.g. bug 152490).</font> \[dates supported, alternate
    models post 2.0\]

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Support task dependencies.** Many tasks are
    related to other tasks, whether it's because they should be worked
    on in sequence or are subtasks. We should make these dependencies
    explicit in the Task List and Task Editor. (bug 137543)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color="green">**Support working set groupings.** A Task List
    that includes projects from multiple "working spheres" (e.g. Project
    A, Project B, Personal) can become unwieldy and distracting.
    Integration of top-level working sets could address this. (bug
    153573)</font>

## Task Editing

  - <font color="green">**Improve task activity timing.** We currently
    have a task activity mechanism, but it is not explicit enough, and
    does not capture time spent outside of the workbench. It should also
    be extensible to OS-specific monitoring. (bug 135668).</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Increase Task Editor information density**. The
    task editor is a very frequent target of interaction, and we need to
    continue streamlining it. When opened it should show the user the
    most relevant information with minimal clicking and scrolling
    required. (bug 158921).</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Provide task workflow mechanism.** There are many
    common workflows, such as commit/complete/deactivate. We should
    provide a mechanism for specifying and executing task-related
    workflows. This requires direct editing of task data (i.e., without
    editor submission). (bug 160780, bug 124224)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Streamline task creation.** Make it easier to
    create tasks, fork them, or promote local tasks to repository tasks.
    (bug 154896, bug 152211)</font>

## Task Repositories

  - <font color=green>**Make offline cache faster and more robust.** The
    offline cache is currently one large serialized file. We should make
    it more robust so that changes to connectors and the framework do
    not cause the offline data to be cleared. This should make it
    possible to put a repository into offline mode permanently, and
    never lose the task data. (bug 165809)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Improve connectivity problem and performance
    handling.** Lack of or degraded connectivity should be transparent,
    and jobs should be cancellable. (bug 165833)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Improve synchronization control**. Consider
    allowing synchronization to be controlled per repository (bug
    165473), and allowing repositories to be put into offline mode (bug
    165809).\</font

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Improve consistency between local and repository
    tasks.** Need to consider how to promote task between local and
    repository, and whether local tasks should be a kind of repository.
    (bug 124321)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Provide standard XML for tasks.** To make
    creating connectors easier, we could provide a canonical and
    extensible XML for for tasks that we use for retrieving task
    data.</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <s>**Streamline task searching**. It is currently impossible to
    search through local and cached task data. We could improve the
    search experience by providing Google-style syntax in the *Task
    List* find box, e.g. severity=critical. (bug 163341)</s> \[deferred
    post 2.0, dependent on Platform, relying on Ctrl+H search instead\]

## Task-Focused UI

  - <font color="green">**Provide preview and editing of task context.**
    For submitting and retrieving contexts, or wanting to inspect a
    context for a non-active task, we should provide a preview pane.
    This should also support operations such as merge and element
    deletion. (bug 107259)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Support debugging views**. This includes
    improved filtering of the thread tree, and automatic
    toggling/loading of breakpoints with task context.<font color=green>
    \[thread tree supported, breakpoints post 2.0\]

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Provide task context relation navigation.** The
    *Active Search* that we deprecated provided relationship navigation.
    This facility could be re-introduced with an in-place view of
    relations between elements, e.g. calls, implements. (bug
    104052)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=gray>**Preserve element identity through refactoring.**
    Currently only the active context participates in refactoring. We
    either need to maintain a dependency map to update the element
    handles of inactive contexts, or migrate them when they are
    activated, via the refactoring history. (bug 164243)</font>

## General

  - <font color=green>**Hyperlinking everywhere**. Wherever structured
    elements show up, we should be hyperlinking them (e.g. bug
    165827)</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Improve error handling and resolution.** When an
    error happens, we should do automatic duplicate detection, and if no
    duplicate is found prompt to submit a bug to the failing
    plug-in.</font> \[submission and detection are still on-demand, not
    automatic\]

<!-- end list -->

  - **Generalize task and context storage mechanisms.** Our API
    currently specifies files and paths as the storage mechanism, but it
    should be general, to allow for alternate mechanisms such as
    server-based storage. (bug 171346)

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Improve representation of people**. Support real
    names, selecting CCs, content assist for fields with people. The
    user's identity should be represented in the UI (e.g. different icon
    when user appears in the CC list).</font>

<!-- end list -->

  - <font color=green>**Personal monitoring and usage sharing**. We
    require data from the Mylar monitor to inform our UI design. We
    should also make this data available to others, since it will
    include general Eclipse usage statistics. In order to provide users
    with an incentive to share their (anonymous) usage data we should
    include personal interaction monitoring facilities.</font>
