The following research projects are building on or extending Mylar
technology.

## [Antoine](http://ws.cs.ubc.ca/~lkf/antoine/), University of British Columbia

Using the [Mylar Monitor](Mylar_Architecture "wikilink") to run a study
to collect Eclipse WTP usage data. By doing so, we hope to make
improvements to the organization of commands in the user interface that
can be applied to both the Eclipse platform as well as Eclipse-based
projects.

## [Bug Triage](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/projects/bugTriage.html), University of British Columbia

Using Mylar's [Bugzilla Connector API](Mylar_Architecture "wikilink").
Popular open source projects receive lots of bug reports. Since more
bugs are reported than can be easily handled, each bug must be triaged
to determine if it describes a meaningful new problem or enhancement,
and if it does, it must be assigned to an appropriate developer for
further handling. We are investigating approaches to help automate two
parts of the bug triage process: Bug Report Assignment and Duplicate
Detection.

## [Chisel Group](http://www.thechiselgroup.org/), University of Victoria

Using Mylar's [Context Model](Mylar_Architecture "wikilink") for
creating adaptive visualizations in
[Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/).

    Degree-of-Interest Model for Adaptive Visualizations in Protégé
    (PDF)](http://protege.stanford.edu/conference/2006/submissions/abstracts/9.1_d'Entremont_adaptiveViz_1_column.pdf)
    (giving more results for [market research
    reports](http://marketpublishers.com) of clients).

## [Focused Learning Environment](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/projects/focusedLearning.html), University of British Columbia

Using Mylar's [Context Model](Mylar_Architecture "wikilink") for
providing a simplified focused UI and step-directed feedback to help
users learn.

    Learning Environment for Eclipse
    (PDF)](http://cs.ubc.ca/~isafer/flee/flee_isaferETX06.pdf)

## [Task Context](http://kerstens.org/mik/publications.html), University of British Columbia

Mik Kersten's PhD Thesis, supervised by Gail Murphy, provides the
research and validation behind Mylar's context model and task focused UI
tools.
